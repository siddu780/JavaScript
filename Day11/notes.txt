Note:-*** - Javascript is a  Synchronous (Single threaded language)

Asynchronous:- making javascript to work multiple work simulataneously.

1.setTimeout() :- It is a web api used to perform asynchronous opeartion in certain timeoout.
synatx :-      setTimeout(callbackfn , timeout);
2.setInterval() :- It is a web api used to perform async operations for evry interval of specified time.
syntax :-    setInterval(callbackfn , timeinterval);

3.Promise (es6 feature):- It is an Object which represents eventual completion or failures of asynchronous operations.
        
        states of promise :-
        1.pending :-  still ongoing
        2.fulfilled:-  successfully completed
        3.rejected:- failueres
syntax :-   let p = new Promise((resolve , reject)=>{});

- for handling the promise we have a instance methods,
                1.then() :- it is used to handle successful data.
                2.catch() :- it is used to handle errors.
                3.finally() :- finally will execute for both success & failures once the promise settles.


4.Async & await :-
async :- this keyword makes synchronous function as asynchronous function and start to execute promise.

await :- this keyword will make the function to wait untill promise completes
