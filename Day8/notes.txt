Note:- JavaScript is synchronous (Single threaded language)

Asynchronous :- making 
methods:-
1.SetTimeout() :- It is a web api used to perform asynchronous opearations
        Syntax :- SetTimeout(callbackfn,timeout);
2.SetInterval() :- It is used to perform async operations for every interval of specified time.
        Syntax :- SetInterval(callbackfn,timeinterval);
3.Promise(es6 feature) :- It is an object which represents eventual completion or failures of async opearations
        States of promise:
        1.pending:-still going
        2.fulfilled:-successfully completed
        3.rejected:-failures
syntax:- let x = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{});
-to handle the promise - we have to use instance methods,
        1.then() :- it is used to handle successful data
        2.catch() :- it is used to handle errors
        3.finally() :- it will execute for bothe success & failures f
4. Async & wait :-
