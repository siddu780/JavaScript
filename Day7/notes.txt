2. Anonymous functions :- function which does not have a name to declare
 - anonymous function cannot be executed immediately.
3. Function expressions :- Function declaration is assigned as a value to variable and the same function will be invoked with the help of variable.
4. Immediate invoke functions expressions(IIFE) :- once the function is created, it should be immediately invoked.
 - IIFE can be executed only one time.
5. Arrow function :- concises the syntax of normal function
syntax:- ()=>{}
 - similar to anonymous function
6. Higher Order function :- Higher Order function is a function which accepts another function as an argument/value to its parameter.
7. Callback Function :- Callback function is a function which is passed as value/arguments to another function.
