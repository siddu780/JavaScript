operators:-
***********
- operators are spacial type of symbols used to perform some operations
on operands.

ex: -  2(operand1)*(symbol)3(operand2)

- unary 
- binary
- ternary

1. arithmatic operator:-
**************************
+ , - , * , / , % ,** , ++ , --
concatenation :- joinign of two or more string
typecasting:- changing one data type into another dattype.
NaN :- Not a number :- it is a specail type of number which is not leagl in javascript.
 

 increment :- 
        1.pre-increment :- it will increment the value by one before execution
        2.post-increment :- it will increment the value by one after executuion.

assignment operator:-
= , += , -= , /= , %= , *= 
let a =10;
clg(a+5)

relational operators:-
***********************
- relational operators always return boolean values.
== , === , != , !==(strictly not equals) , > , >= , < , <=

what is different between "==" & "===" ?(FAQ)
- "==" it will check only the values not the datatypes.
- "===" it will check both values and datatypes.


logical operators:-
*******************
 AND(&&) - it will return true only when both side conditions are true else return false
 OR(||) - it will return true when both side is true as well as anyone side is true else false.
 NOT(!) - it will make true as falsa and false as true.

 decision making statements:-
 ****************************
 if :- if block will execute only when the condition is true.
 - we can give only one condition for if 
 if-else :- if we ewant to display either of true / false we use if else block.
 - this also works with one condition.
 else if ladder
 switch
 ternery condition

 looping statements:-
 *********************
- looping statements are used to iterate the block of codes multiple times.
 1.for loop :- 
 -minimum iteration count of forloop is "0".
 syntax :-  for(initialization ; condition; updation)
                        {
                                //statemets
                        }
 2.while loop
 - minimum iteration count of while loop is "0".
 syntax :-  while(condition){
                        //statement
                        updation
                }
 3.do-while loop
 - minimum iteration count of d-while lool is "1".
 synatx :- do{
                //statements
                }while(condition)

- what are the entry controlled loop and exit controlled loop?
- for loop & while loops are entry controlled loops.
- do-while is a exit controlled loop.
